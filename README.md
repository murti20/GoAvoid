# GoAvoid: A Computer Program for Mobile Robot Path Planning
    
GoAvoid® software is a path planner application for mobile robots that take advantage of GDI+ graphical user interface, which is a 
class-based API for C/C++ programmers in Microsoft Windows®. It is developed as an open-source framework for researchers who work 
on the mobile robot path planning research field. The software includes a simple working algorithm for obstacle avoidance in the          workspace cluttered with both stationary and moving obstacles. The researchers can use the program as a starting point to develop          their own algorithms.The software is developed in Microsoft Visual Studio NET. and easy to install and implement. It is available 
from https://github.com/ominnetoglu/GoAvoid/.
     
 The GoAvoid software has a detailed documentation. The documentation is available from        https://github.com/ominnetoglu/GoAvoid/tree/master/GoAvoid_Windows/manual

This documentation describes the setup and usage of GoAvoid. All functions and related menu structures are explained in detail.
